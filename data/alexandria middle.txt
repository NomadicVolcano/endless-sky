			`	Their "songs" have a beat faster than a heart attack accompanied by down-tuned guitars played so hard they're almost percussion instruments. There are lyrics, but nobody understands them they are since they are screamed incomprehensibly in a guttural tone. Their fans call the sound, "soothing." Doctors call it, "carcinogenic."`
