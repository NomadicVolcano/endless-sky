Many of these were professionals such as doctors, engineers, farmers, and scientists. Teeneep has stayed behind to try to convince the Hai to join the Unfettered Hai.

			`The Unfettered Hai were greeted with a victory parade honoring them as heroes. Teeneep explained, "During the Korath war, there were traditions of parades in honor of those that returned and banquets in memory of those that fell. Those are viewed as barbaric celebrations of violence by some Hai today, the same Hai that abandoned my family to slavery. I used the last of the craven Elders' ransom payment to fund large parades and banquets. You're invited, of course."`
			`	At the end of the celebrations, the Unfettered Hai took with them whoever would come. They had to purchase three new ships and rent the nine Centipedes to fit thousands of volunteers. Two thirds of the freed slaves joined, along with family members throughout Hai space. Numerous doctors, engineers, scientists, farmers, and soldiers joined too. The Unfettered promised none of them would be forced to fight other Hai. They would work to build the True Hai nation, or fight aliens.`
