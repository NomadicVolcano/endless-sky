# The Hai Slave Rescue story has multiple layers, with things going on
# behind the scenes that are not immediately obvious. A player that
# reads the story, and comes back to think about it later, will
# probably figure out some of it. Maybe all of it. So far, reviewers
# don't; they focus on the treatment of their favorite faction without
# thinking about whether there's more going on that forces their
# faction to behave as they do.

# For the sake of the reviewers, I've added annotations explaining
# what else is happening.

# This story sets up a situation with no easily solution, but where
# delay is a possibility. Slaves are held in a secure facility guarded
# not by mindless pirates, but by professional mercenaries under the
# command of rich Syndicate executives. If a thousand idiots with
# pistols attack, they'll die before they reach the gate. Even if they
# do get in, they're likely to get the slaves killed. You need a
# powerful ground combat force and a large group of special
# operatives. That kind of operation has a huge expense and requires
# careful planning and secrecy.

# The leaders have time for careful planning because the slavers are
# studying the slaves for a few months before shipping them out. By
# the time the shipments become a possibility, the Navy, Republic
# Intelligence, non-extremist Syndicate, and possibly even the Hai,
# already have people monitoring the planet. They may even have agents
# in the facility itself.

# Teeneep, the hero of the story, is a prominent civil rights activist
# among the Hai, and knows what the slaves are going through
# (including her enslaved family). She's also a clever politician, and
# adapts her responses to every situation, including fooling a
# merchant captain into thinking she's a daft and helpless mother. She
# wants to get the slaves out alive, not as red paste or ashes. More
# than that, she wants to ensure nothing like this ever happens
# again. By the end of the story, she's manipulated the political
# situation so the Hai public has anti-Human and pro-Unfettered
# feelings, with her as a demagogue in charge of a popular political
# movement. Soon she'll probably be a powerful Elder whose views
# cannot be ignored.

			`	The second Elder adds, "Our agreement with the Human Republic is very clear: Hai do not enter Human space without permission from the topmost levels of both governments. The risk of instability to both countries is too great if we are discovered prematurely.`
			`	"We know the locations of all Hai in Human space with permission to be there, and none are on Stormhold.

			`	When you reach the meeting room, you see three men in formal uniforms. One is from Republic Intelligence, Agent Kopkow. Admiral Cain you know as the head of the Republic Navy forces that patrol nearest the wormhole. Captain Wallace wears the Parliamentary Medal of Valor, which is given only to one officer per year.`
			# Admiral Cain commands probably 1/12 of the entire Navy. He's likely two

			# examined by parliament daily. The Republic Intelligence agent is
			# there to remind him of that. Parliament's will shall be obeyed.
			
			# He has an ace up his sleeve though: Captain Wallace. To get such a
			# prestigious award, the captain must have substantial support in
			# parliament, and public support as a war hero. That gives him the
			# freedom to say things the Admiral can't.
			
			choice
				`	(Continue.)`
			`	After Teeneep's lengthily explanation, Admiral Cain is the first to respond, "Enslavement through kidnapping is common occurrence on the edge of Human space. Most of the crew on a pirate ship are slaves; teenagers or young adults forced into service. Many slaves are smuggled past the Navy to the Paradise Worlds or Syndicate to act as personal slaves or laborers in dangerous environments. Unfortunately, rescue is nearly impossible.`
			# The above facts can be seen throughout pirate hails, spaceport
			# messages, and various stories.
			
			`	"Human pirates will do anything to avoid capture, including using their own slaves as shields. During any capture attempt, 50-80% of the slaves die. The Navy loses three soldiers for every one slave freed. Against a well-defended facility like you describe, it may be five to one or more. Long-term, even WE cannot sustain those losses.`
			`	"The Republic has a far more effective way of combating slavery."`
			choice
				`	(Continue.)`
			`	Captain Wallace is visibly angry and almost growling. A stern look from Admiral Cain quickly calms him down.`
			# It isn't time for the Admiral's secret weapon yet.
			# The weapon needs to calm down and wait.
			
			# What the admiral is about to say is the truth, as the game is written.
			# The player should not be shielded from the psychotic misdeeds of
			# the Navy, or themselves.
			
			`	The Admiral continues, "The Navy has a strict policy on slaves in pirate custody: do not rescue. If we see a disabled pirate ship, we don't offer surrender. We shoot the ship, killing every teenage slave soldier onboard. If we detect a ship smuggling slaves, even women and children, we don't attempt an arrest. We destroy the ship. If they free themselves, and come to us for sanctuary, we'll accept them. That's the only condition in which we rescue.`
			`	"The Navy's policy is harsh, even inhumane, but it is the only effective way we've found to reduce slavery. Captains are afraid to become slavers because it is a death sentence, no matter the cost. Slave owners know they'll lose their investment as soon as it is discovered. Captured Humans are willing to fight to the death to avoid slavery since they know they'll probably die when the pirates are caught.`
			# Note, "The Navy's policy," not "Parliament's policy." The Navy is
			# the servant of Parliament. Parliament's orders are the Navy's
			# orders.
			
			`	"I wish there was another way, but there isn't." You can see by his expression that his words are sincere.`
			# How would his words have changed if Republic Intelligence wasn't
			# present? I will leave you to wonder.
			
			choice
				`	(Continue.)`
			`	Teeneep's face is filled with confusion that quickly changes to utter horror. "They're your own people. Vulnerable, tortured, victims. You kill them by the thousands?"`
			`	"Millions," Captain Wallace corrects her, getting visibly angry again. "Estimates are between 900,000 and 1,300,000 per year. Of those, at least 40,000 are younger than the age of seven and at least 20,000 are pregnant women."`
			# Now the Admiral's secret weapon is unleashed. It seems
			# Captain Wallace may be deviating from the scripted
			# conversation.
			
			`	Agent Kopkow interjects, "Yes, but those numbers have steadily decreased. Fifty years ago, there were twenty times as many slaves in Human space. Our methods may be brutal, but they are effective. Later generations will look at us as villains, but they will be grateful for the freedom we won them."`
			# Captain Wallace forced Republic Intelligence to be on the defensive.
			# Republic Intelligence is defending inhumane policies, making
			# themselves seem much worse than the Navy. The Navy wants Teeneep
			# to take that impression back with her to the Hai public.
			
			choice
				`	(Continue.)`
			`	Captain Wallace asks, "These are enslaved Hai. Surely we can make an exception, in the name of galactic peace?" From his voice, it sounds like that was a rhetorical question.`
			# The captain sarcastically returns to his script.
			
			`	Agent Kopkow rolls his eyes, "As the captain knows full well, tens of thousands of your people sneak into Human space every year, in violation of our countries' agreement. An estimated 17% of them die within a year and 33% within five years. About 9% join the pirates willingly, not as slaves. These are all risk-takers who suffer from their shortsightedness. Parliament won't accept a large sacrifice of Navy lives to save a group of alien criminals."`
			# Read: "Stop wandering out of Hai territory and this will stop happening."
			# A stern warning to bring back to the Hai populace.
			
			`	Teeneep ears perk up as she hears her family's vacation referred to as, "shortsighted risk-taking by alien criminals."`
			`	Before she can correct the agent, Captain Wallace interrupts, "What about the possible Syndicate involvement?"`
			# Captain Wallace keeps Teeneep on script so he can
			# make his later contact.
			
			choice
				`	(Continue.)`
			`	Agent Kopkow says, "That does concern me. Aliens with advanced technology in the hands of Syndicate extremists?"`
			`	Admiral Cain nods in agreement, "I'll ask Navy Intelligence to confirm your story. We'll send agents and reconnaissance drones. If they prove your words true, I'm sure I can convince my superiors to take the base intact. We'll have to interrogate the surviving slaves, and press charges against any collaborators. I'm sure the vast majority will be allowed to return home."`
			`	"I think I can promise Parliament's support for that, and Republic Intelligence as well. We should have some answers in a month or two."`
			# Teeneep is informed of the decision Parliament already made
			# several days ago when they were contacted by the Hai Elders.
			# Now she'll take back the message, hopefully letting the
			# Hai populace know the Navy is doing what it can within
			# its political limitations. Those limitations are now
			# painfully clear.
			
			`	"Then it's agreed. Captain, you can see the lady out."`
			choice
				`	(Continue.)`
			`	The captain walks you all the way to your ship telling stories of Navy brutality and heroism towards slaves. Apparently there is a lot of dissension in the ranks about that and other questionable Navy orders.`
			`	"See this man," he says, handing you a card. "I'll let him know you're coming. He may be able to help."`
			# Now the admiral's secret weapon strikes. In addition

			`Syndicate's Executive Moray meets you at your ship when you land and walks you to a nearby meeting room.`
			# It is clear Captain Wallace told him to expect you. He had
			# several days to plan his response.

			# Anecdotes in the below paragraph are based on pirate spaceport messages:

			`	"I know what you're going through," he says. "When I was a teenager, pirates kidnapped my brother and father, and forced them to serve on pirate vessels. My father watched helplessly as my brother's disabled ship was destroyed by a Navy Frigate just as it exited hyperspace. My father eventually escaped. He is serving his seventeenth year of a twenty-five year sentence for piracy, even though his deeds were against his will.`
			`	"You see the hails of the Navy: loyalty, honor, bravery. Half-truths at best. We see the Navy as heroes because they are the only large organization capable of self-sacrifice. Yes, they do many good deeds. Those deeds blind us to their brutality and immorality.`
			
			# The following is true, as proven by the Navy's response to the attack on Zenith:
			
			`	"Stay with the Navy long enough, and they will ask you to commit an atrocity in their name. They are more concerned with their image, and Republic stability, than basic morality. Morality must be sacrificed if one is to achieve stability."`
			`	You see a knowing look on Teeneep's face. "I fight for civil rights in a society that has not advanced in millennia. Your last ten words describe my people's history."`
			# A typical view of a frustrated civil rights activist.
			# Sometimes that view is correct.

			choice
				`	(Continue.)`
			`	"In my time as a Syndicate executive, I have smuggled over 80,000 slaves from pirate planets to freedom in Syndicate space. If I smuggle any of your people back here, I will tell you immediately.`
			# Apparently Executive Moray didn't deal with his grief through
			# revenge. He's a clever, calculating, man, who has used his
			# power to fight the ills of society. 80,000 people won't go
			# through what his family went through.
			
			`	"Unfortunately, I cannot arrange a rescue. The Syndicate is not equipped for a large-scale ground assault of such a well-defended facility. Only the Navy, or your people, can do that."`
			# Reinforcing the premise of the story.

			`	"I swear to you, I will track down those in my company that are responsible for this reprehensible act. They will be brought to justice."`
			# As with the Navy, he is expecting this to get back to the Hai
			# public. He doesn't want the view of the Syndicate there to be
			# a corporation of criminals. He wants to make sure they know
			# the company tries to do what is right.

			choice
				`	(Continue.)`
			`	After some more discussion, Teeneep concludes that she won't receive help any time soon in Human space. The Republic will wait months, and the slaves may be sold by then. The Syndicate is powerless to help.`
			# An exaggeration. Is she truly delusional, or is this
			# a calculated move to advance her plans?
			
			`	Teeneep turns to you and says, "Let's return to Hai-home and report my failure. Maybe they'll help now that they know the Humans have abandoned us."`
