			`You arrive on Earth and take a series of shuttles to get to Fez, Morocco where you expect to meet Daemos Titan.  As with all old cities, the outer regions are monstrous mega-buildings built in the last few centuries.  As you move inward, you see skyscrapers of the 20th to 22nd centuries.`

				`	Enter the library...`
			`On your way to the library, a scruffy-looking man approaches you.  He has a rather large gun in his holster and a massive book strapped to his back.  He starts staring intently at you, or possibly through you.  His dark red sunglasses and porcupine beard make it difficult to read his face (or even see it).  When the man abruptly stops walking you consider yelling for help, fearing you're about to be mugged.`
			`	Suddenly he seems startled as if from some terrible gastrointestinal distress.  He dives to the nearest bench, pulls the gigantic book off of his back, and starts jotting notes.  You're not sure he even noticed you.  His mind had wandered to whatever metaphysical world scholars occupy when reality has no bearing on their lives.`

			`	Between bouts of mumbling, reading, ranting, and writing, the man strokes his beard as if petting a cat.  Eventually his frantic scribbling on the giant book runs off the bottom of a page and his pencil breaks.  He looks sad for a moment, and then notices you.`

			`When you arrive, you see Daemos Titan eager to depart.  He walks at a brisk pace towards your ship without even telling you his destination.  Porters behind push a cart with an impressive number of books and at least a thousand pencils.  You notice there is no modern equipment; not even a data pad.`

You're fairly certain it wasn't meant as a hostile gesture.  This man simply hasn't talked to anyone other than himself for so long that he's forgotten basic social graces.`

			`Shroud is a planet of anachronisms.  In the high mountains, vast castles of medieval design house the pampered ultra-rich, living as if in a Victorian era.  Hidden behind expensive paintings can be found all the comforts of the modern era: virtual reality booths, food-synthesizing devices, massive panel screens for tracking stocks, and the like.  Down below, the poor live in cramped conditions no better than medieval serfs, using modern technology when required by their by employers.`
			`	Daemos wasn't interested in any of that though.  He took you below the cloud cities of the rich, beyond the factory towns, past the countryside, through a marsh, into a hidden temple, beneath a fake support column, and down to a subterranean room.  In the center of the room, an impossibly old monk was meditating with his eyes closed.  He hovered a half meter above the ground humming in an almost guttural tone.  Within his hands was a book.`
