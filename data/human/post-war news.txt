			"I hear the Pug were so frail we could squish them. How can a race so weak get such powerful ships?"
			"The Pug went easy on us, if you ask me. I bet they have ships far more powerful, hiding among the stars. Why didn't they use them?"
			"Did you hear about the shattered ringworld? How did the Pug destroy a structure so strong, and why?"
			"Why didn't our governments discover the Pug before they got so strong?"
			"Why didn't the Pug attack earlier?"
			"I wonder if the Quarg know about the Pug?"
			"Are the Pug really evil, or do they have some kind of plan for us?"
			"I thought it was just humans and Quarg in this galaxy, until we met the Pug. How many other alien races are out there? Are we ready for them?"
			"Do the Pug even see us as people? They act like we're just stories in a big game of theirs."

			"Did you hear about the smashed ringworld? I bet that came from a Pug-Quarg war. If the Quarg can't beat the Pug, why did we win our war?"
			"Accursed Quarg. I never trust anyone twice my size. Yes, I'm a meter and a half tall. Stop laughing."
			"The Quarg always treat us like little kids when we visit. That's so rude."
			"I never trusted those Quarg with their strange side-blinking eyes, and I never will!"
			"I wonder if the Quarg have been manipulating our society for millennia. Or was it the Pug? Or another alien race? Biblical plagues? World War II? How many atrocities did they cause?"
			"I'm never going to a Quarg planet again. I swear they read your mind and plant nightmares within. I keep dreaming of mighty space-cockroaches, reptiles, and big robot-ships. Owls! Owls everywhere!"

			"A merchant was flying me back from one of the frontier core worlds, and we were attacked by a ship as big as a carrier. The engines were so hot they glowed."
			"Nobody believes me, but I think there is another alien race out in the far east near the core."

			"On my way home from a trip five systems away, I saw this big teardrop-shaped ship with castles on it. It was huge! Bigger than a Navy Cruiser. I bet it was an alien ship. It seemed friendly though."
			"I saw a man walking down the street... or I thought it was a man, until it walked past a transformer. The man flickered; it was a hologram covering some kind of fuzzy creature."
			"I saw Nuclear Martini playing at a concert on Prime, and I swear the hairy drummer is some kind of giant squirrel."
			"There's these game conventions up in the paradise worlds, and I see a lot of short kids wearing full-body squirrel outfits. I'm starting to wonder if they're really aliens."
			"There was a crashed ship near me, and I heard rumors of some crazy squirrel inside. The police cleaned it up really quick and now all we see is some scorch marks. The authorities won't say anything."
			"The pickled acorns they sell in the store taste so good they can't possibly be of human manufacture."

			"We assumed this planet was always inhabitable, but it turns out it had a dangerously-toxic atmosphere a while ago. The Pug made it fertile again, and according to our studies, they did it in under 40 years."
			"The Pug left the strangest objects behind for us to study. It's like solving a thousand educational puzzles."
			"Studying this planet will accelerate human science by decades. Maybe centuries. I think the Pug may have done us more good than harm."
			"I used to think the Pug were evil after all they did, but look at the consequences of their actions. We're at peace, we allied together as a single species, and we have endless technology to study."
			"I found the strangest holographic art piece. Both the technology and aesthetics were elegant. I saw no transmitters; they must be using nanotransmitters or something. It's amazing!"
			"We make a major breakthrough every day on this planet."
			"I think we're starting to really understand the principles behind interstellar travel now, at a far deeper level than we ever thought possible."
			"My grandmother came out of retirement just to study this planet. She's terminally ill, but she's sworn to work here until the day she dies. These discoveries are that important to her."
			"I'm skipping my honeymoon to research this city. I hope I don't end up divorced."
			"We had to add four new elements to the periodic table in the first week we studied this place."
			"There's a building near here where space literally folds in upon itself and gravity goes in multiple directions. You can walk in one direction and come back the way you came in, up-side-down. We have a nurse station outside for the inevitable concussions."
			"It's odd, but some of the buildings near here bear a striking resemblance to ancient Minoan architecture. We also found tablets with Sanskrit writing and samples of ancient cave paintings. How long have the Pug been manipulating us?"
			"We're still studying what lies beyond the wormhole. There's a never-ending slue of discoveries from the Quarg ruins that are almost as valuable as what we found on this planet."
			"There are residual space-time distortions at the Quarg ringworld past the wormhole. We suspect it was moved in minutes. The energy required would be more than the total energy ever produced by the human race."
			"A ringworld is such a stupid idea. If you break clean through one piece, the centrifugal force tears the whole ring apart. If the Quarg were smart, they would've made a Dyson swarm instead."

			"Them Syndicate was torn in half by the Pug. Serves them right, I say. They make it too hard to earn a dishonest living around here."
			"It just ain't right. The Pug should've smashed up Earth. They're anarchists like us, you know? Sneak in, blow up things, demand obedience. Why did they stop? Just ain't right."
			"When I was little, and our gang was fighting, my gang's leader used to threaten to kill us so we'd unite against him. Then he smacked us around until we did what he said. I bet that's what the Pug did. It worked, too."
			"Psychological manipulation, that's all it is. Any good anarchist will tell you that's what the Pug are all about. Murder, death, kill... to trick you into doing what THEY want."
			"I wish the Pug hadn't stopped the Syndicate from nuking Earth. Can you imagine the collapse of the galactic Republic? Galactic anarchy! It's how the galaxy should be."

			"I hear a rich pirate gang to the north tried to capture one of those big alien ships near Stormhold. They packed a Bactrian with four hundred teenagers and nerve gas. I don't know if they won the fight. Waste of slaves if you ask me."
			"My captain installed two of those big alien turrets that shoot yellow sparks. Now we can throw Syndicate Wasps half way across the star system."
			"We captured one of those alien fighters near Stormhold. I'm not sure what the creature was that we found inside, but I can tell you it was delicious. Our ship's chef really knows his trade."
			"From an alien ship near Stormhold, my crew pillaged one of the... sparkle drive systems? We jumped past human space and regretted it quickly. I sold the drive to the Syndicate for a hefty sum. Let them deal with the insanity that lies beyond."
