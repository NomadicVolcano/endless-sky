# This file will contain the map of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)
# and the intergalactic space leading from the vicinity of the
# Coalition to the SMC. Presently only the beginning of the
# intergalactic space is here.

# Amazinite requested that each galaxy have its own map, and that we
# could choose which galaxy map will have the intergalactic route that
# connects them. In the stories we have planned, the intergalactic
# route will primarily exist as your first entrance to the SMC, so it
# makes more sense to have it here.

# The "planet" definition of wormholes between the Milky Way and this
# region of space will be in map.txt since that is the first galaxy
# where they're relevant



# Art and design notes:

# - Lone systems with no purple around them in the map have no haze
#   (_menu/haze-black) to emphasize how dark it is. I'll dim the star
#   field too if there is a way to do that.

# - The high frequency of asteroids keeps the critters busy.  Some
#   critters have naturally-occurring Hyperdrives, so there is a
#   steady supply of them.

# - In a later update, the player will be able to land on nearly every
#   gas giant in a ship with Gaslining. These will be habitats for the
#   critters.

# - There are no locals to name systems, so their names sound like
#   they're from an astronomical survey. We'll add a later mission to
#   Earth to visit the astronomical institute that surveyed this space.
#   (The obvious exception is the Pirate system.)

# - Pirates are only inside their system since their supply of jump
#   drives is extremely limited.  They used pairs of jump drives to
#   ferry one ship at a time. You'll find them elsewhere only when
#   needed for stories.

	description `There are a few sturdy mesas on which to land, but most of this planet is rough rock and dirt. Despite the lack of sunlight, the surface is warm. There must be internal processes in the planet generating heat. The scanners on your computer show a network of caves reaching deep below ground. There's high radiation in the caves, too much to support human life. Crystalline formations that coat the cave walls block detailed scans. Advanced geological scanners might enlighten you further.`
	description `There are automated deuterium refineries on this planet, siphoning deuterium from cave walls. The refinery equipment looks Hai in origin. Some mesas have fuel pumps, filling containers with fuel for later transport to the planet's moon.`

planet "Philosopher's Paradise"
	attributes "whispering void"
	landscape land/space2
	description `Beneath the surface of this small moon, there is a network of corridors and large rooms. The architecture looks mostly Human, but with a hint of Hai. Most are blocked off by sturdy doors with keycard access and plentiful security cameras. Frequently, you see a symbol similar to the Syndicate logo. Everywhere you walk, a security camera turns to track your movement. You get the feeling that you're not welcome here.`
