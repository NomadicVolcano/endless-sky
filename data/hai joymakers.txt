		description `This nigh-uninhabitable planet is home to a small group of Hai dissidents.  Elsewhere in the Hai Dystopia, public displays of negative emotion are banned. Depressing or angry media are forbidden, and fighting against oppression caries the highest penalties. Here, all Dystopian mores are ignored, freedom of expression is the law, and thought is never a crime.`

	# Darkwaste's system is a nonstop battle between Joymakers and
	# Hai Dissidents.  The Joymakers usually win. The Quarg
	# presence is unchanged but Hai and Merchants groups are now
	# rare.  Syndicate and Pirate ships visit to smuggle goods to
	# the dissidents.
