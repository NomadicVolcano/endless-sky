			`	"Watch this," says Lilith smugly.`
			`	When the crane releases the skin onto your ship, the skin quivers and shakes, as if it is pondering the same question that you were. Then it flattens and spreads out in tentacles along the ship's surface. It closes up holes in vulnerable areas, and you can see it repairing gashes from recent battle damage. In a few minutes, your hull is fully repaired and even the paint seems new. The alien skin is only visible as thin strands wrapping around your ship's hull.`

In its dormant state, it still blocks most scanners and radars, acts as a weak ramscoop, and slowly repairs your hull. There is a small, but constant, energy drain to provide the skin's nutritional needs. Unfortunately, it is also quite dense. The marauder scientist Lilith had a pang of conscience and asked you to find a way to destroy this skin, lest it fall into the wrong hands."
