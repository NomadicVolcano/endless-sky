			`	You feel as if a vast and patient creature has just heaved an immense sigh. "Human, you would do well not to ignore the warning of an Archon. I am here to warn off those who might be harmed by the swarm intelligence that infests this system. If you remain here long your ship will be digested by the swarm."`

			`	"What is this swarm?" you ask.`
			label swarm
			`	"Self-replicating miniature robots," the voice replies. "A weapon created by the Korath, the last of their great abominations. If you wish to feed your ship to the swarm, I will not stop you, but they already possess enough raw material here without your assistance." The voice's tone, inasmuch as a disembodied imaginary voice can be said to have a tone, is sardonic.`

					goto end
				`	"Wait, I have more questions."`
			`	"Yes?"`
			`	You ask, "Why don't you just destroy the swarm, if it is so dangerous?"`
			`	The voice says, "Because if the Korath manage to drive themselves extinct, this intelligence will be their last and greatest surviving creation, and we will preserve it as a living memorial to them. Please do not interfere here." When the voice speaks the phrase, "drive themselves extinct," the words are accompanied by an emotion that you cannot put a name to.`
			`	Also, the empty space around your ship is beginning to light up with small sparks, like an angry swarm of fireflies.`
			choice
				`	"Well, it's an honor to meet you. I'll be leaving now."`
					goto end
				`	"Why do you care if they go extinct?"`
			`	"Our directive is to enforce peace and prevent extinction," says the voice. As before, the words "prevent extinction" echo loud in your mind as if underlined by a nameless emotion. "Now, enough questions," says the voice.`
