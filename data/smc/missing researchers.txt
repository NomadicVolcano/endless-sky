			`You look ahead a few dozen meters and you see a short man with a strange necklace. As he walks past a power transfer unit, the man shimmers and you see faintly-visible, squirrel-like, features.

			`	Duniip turns off his hologram and addresses his family, "I found us a pilot! He's going to take us all the way home." This was followed by four cheering family members and one baby's gurgle.`
			`	The family was already packed to leave. Duniip explains they move regularly so they're not found. It takes them under two minutes to finish preparations and don their holoprojectors.`
			`	Your walk back to the ship is largely uneventful until some men with strange scanners detect the Yeertle family. One man throws a small grenade with a green light on top. You recognize it as a low-level EMP device. All five holograms turn off, along with all computers within twenty meters. Fortunately, your ship is outside that range.`

				goto questions

			`	A Hai near Teeneep responds. "Yes... and no. Apart from our own people, we're regularly in contact with police. They investigate the disappearances, and sometimes find the missing person. Other times, they eventually have to give up and work on other crimes.`
			`	"Our biggest problem is the lack of help in human space. Local police are generally overwhelmed with crime in the regions where the kidnapping victims are found. There, kidnappings are commonplace. In the areas where the victims were taken, there's virtually no evidence. Your navies and intelligence agencies haven't the time to help us; they're busy cleaning up after the war. There is a lot of unfinished business in Syndicate space they don't want to talk about.`
			`	"Since this problem is tiny compared to the total crime in Hai space, the Hai Elders haven't made it a large priority. They tell me that, if we can prove the kidnappings are from a coordinated effort, they'll put all the resources they can spare into stopping the crime. So far, they say, their investigators have been unable to discover anything.`

			`	You pass through another two grey platform transports and reach a warm cave-like structure with a group of Korath and Quarg. From the holograms and equipment, it appears they're discussing science. One hologram looks like a blood cell attached to a tiny machine; this may be a nanoscale medicine laboratory.`

"When I was a teenager, pirates kidnapped my brother and father, and forced them to serve on pirate vessels, calling them 'indentured servants.' My father watched helplessly as my brother's disabled ship was destroyed by a Navy Frigate just as it exited hyperspace. My father eventually escaped. He is serving his seventeenth year of a twenty-five-year sentence for piracy, even though his deeds were against his will. Unfortunately, that is how our laws are written.`

Many of our people have been kidnapped over the past few decades, and some still reside beyond the wormhole at Devil-Run. Worst of all, your authorities have killed numerous Hai on slaver ships, without attempting rescue or even offering surrender. We demand the return of our people and the immediate cease of the killing of slaves."`

The pirates are well-entrenched in their planets, and fighting them is a long and brutal struggle. The war left them stronger than ever with our navies distracted fighting one another."`
			`	The President continues, "The Free Worlds has made great strides reducing piracy by befriending the peoples of the anarchist worlds. We're discussing similar approaches with the Republic. Perhaps in another few years, piracy will be entirely eliminated."`
			`	The Prime Minister says, "We have a counter-proposal. The Free Worlds and Republic will establish a customs service on Allhome. Hai visiting human space will check in with us. Our intelligence agencies will track their movements and see to their safety as best we can; they'll be given contacts on every planet to go to for help. In the meantime, we will place extensive surveillance fleets at Ultima Thule to detect any unapproved Hai travel. We will do our best to disable and capture ships with kidnapped Hai, no matter the risk of Navy lives."`

			`You meet Teeneep outside her Centipede and you're surprised to see her with no bodyguards. Instead of her Hai Elder robes, she's wearing what looks like a fencing outfit. There are two swords on her back and several balanced knives on her belt. She's wearing a headband with a medallion on it that looks like an athletic medal.`
			`	She pays you for the trip and says, "These blades are not ceremonial. Leave your gun behind or the Unfettered may think you're an assassin. I'll protect you."`
			`	You hand your gun to a nearby Unfettered, and hope Teeneep is as capable as she claims.`
			`	Now that you see her in this guise, you remember a fencing match advertisement. She looks exactly like the fencing champion a few years ago. Is Teeneep a champion fencer as well as a civil rights leader and Hai Elder? From appearances, she hasn't been in adulthood for long.

			`	In one motion, Teeneep spins around, unsheathes a sword, and cuts the man's arm off at the shoulder. While he's writhing in agony, she cleans her sword on his head, and then re-sheathes it. Teeneep is coated in the man's blood. She walks towards the gigantic leader of the Unfettered, whose face betrays his surprise and admiration.`

Why should we help you? A race of slothful cowards? Your people are an insult to all Hai." He turns and walks away.`
			`	Teeneep dives beneath the man's legs and jumps on a nearby table in front of him. You had forgotten how quick Hai are; few humans could do what she did. She unsheathes both swords and says, "I challenge you for rule of the Unfettered military!"`
			`	"You haven't the authority to do that," he responds, laughing.`
			`	She jumps down and puts both swords at his throat. "Fight me! Are you afraid to fight a woman half your size? Fight me, coward!" From her expression, you're sure if she genuinely has that much faith in her abilities, or if this is a bluff.`
			`	"There is no need," he smiles. "Even on our planets, I've never met a woman half as brave as you. You are a True Hai and we protect our own. You have vouched for the value of the lives of these Hai, so we will send a fleet to rescue them. I will lead the attack myself."`

We cannot spare a large fleet though, so I will need your people to upgrade ten Shield Beetles to our specifications. We'll return your outfits after the battle." He motions to another officer who hands him a data card, "These are the instructions."`

			`	"We understand you have heard most of the story from your spy. This place was founded over a hundred twenty years ago by anarchists from the colony of Freedom. They began kidnapping researchers and engineers, forcing them to devise new weapons or medicines. Our city also has manufacturing facilities where we created goods the pirates could not easily build in human space where their facilities are destroyed regularly.`
			`	"There have been many attempts to take the city by force or by money. Several Alpha groups, the Syndicate, and various illegal organizations, have all tried. Some used chemical or biological weapons. Others sent ships. Many offered money or favors. Philosopher's Paradise has always been an independent country, and always will be.`
			`	"Now that the pirates are gone, the civilians will rule without fear. As you have already destroyed the upper region of the city, we have little to fear from attack by space creatures. Soon we'll have our shipyards at full capacity, so we may defend ourselves.`
			`	"Our research and manufacturing facilities are damaged now, but as repair them we will make them available to you.`
			# (That refers to advanced ships and outfits available after quests.)

			`	"We're scientists, engineers, philosophers, people of learning. There are laboratories throughout this city where people from all three races work together. We seek knowledge. Under the pirates, we were allowed this freedom, as they realized it was the most effective way to get results from scientists. Now that our abusive masters are gone, our research will take peaceful routes.`
			`	"Of course, this is also a city. People have lived here for several generations, multiplying fruitfully. We have had to carve out more and more of the moon. There is plenty of space left before our growth will have to stop.`

			`	"Very little. The pirates wouldn't let us leave the planet, and jump drives are precious to them. They cannot risk drives on science expeditions. Still, we have managed a few trips.`
			`	"There is no evidence that any civilization has ever reached this region of space until us. There are many space-faring indigenous creatures that live in gas giants, and sometimes venture beyond. Most are harmless, so long as you leave them alone. There are flocking apex predators who hunt anything that moves. We suspect there is a north route from here to another galaxy, though we cannot find the starlanes yet.`
			# The starlanes are not concealed. "We cannot find the starlanes" is a
			# fourth wall breaking joke that refers to that part of the game still
			# being under construction. That last sentence will be changed once the
			# SMC is created.
			`	"The planet below is a mystery to us. It has a thousand times the mass it should. Its tremendous gravitational field sustains the large asteroid belt. Somehow though, within a few hundred thousand kilometers of the planet, the gravity is similar to Earth. There are many forms of radiation and strange materials inside the planet's caves. Perhaps, now that we are not developing pirate weapons, we can focus on exploration.`

			`	As you return to your ship, Teeneep interrupts you. "I need you to escort me one last time, Captain <last>. I must return to <destination> to sign a treaty my people have negotiated. You will be well-paid, of course."`
			`	Anticipating your next question, she says, "The Philosophers have paid the other True Hai to remain here on guard until the Philosopher Paradise hangers are repaired. The Republic will dispatch a transport to bring the surviving operatives home, and hopefully leave an ambassador to calm relations."`

		log `The Free Worlds, Republic, and Hai Elders, have signed an agreement to ensure safe passage for Hai in human space, on the condition that they register with a customs authority on Allhome. Any Hai sent against their will into human space will be recovered alive if possible, regardless of the risk to human soldiers. Human authorities will not change their approach towards regular human pirates and slavery though, citing "unsustainable loss of life."`
		log `Teeneep and General Choot'k together, prominent leaders of the Fettered and Unfettered Hai, kissed in a romantic goodbye. They spoke of a future peaceful unification of the Hai.`
		conversation
			`When you land, you, Teeneep, and the Unfettered Hai are greeted as heroes. After a few hours of parades and parties, General Choot'k comes to you and Teeneep to bid farewell.`
			`	He shakes your hand and says, "You're a fine warrior, Captain <last>. You are as much a True Hai as any human can be, and it was an honor to fight alongside you in battle.`
			`	Then he turns to Teeneep and tells her, "You're the future leader of all our people, Teeneep. Come back with me to Darkcloak. Join the True Hai and lead us to victory."`
			`	Teeneep smiles and says, "I have already joined the True Hai in spirit, but my fight is here. I fight for the hearts and minds of our Fettered brethren. One day they will know the True Hai as I do, and we will be one."`
			`	The two come close and look into each other's eyes for a moment before kissing. You're surprised at how complicated open-mouth kissing is when both participants have finger-length incisors.`

				`	(Give them some privacy.)`
			`	As you walk back towards the party, you notice a Carrier and a Dreadnought landing in the distance. You walk towards the landing site, and soon a high-speed Teeneep flies past you saying, "We'll be late! Hurry!"`
			`	After a few minutes of running, you reach a conference hall and see the Prime Minister of the Republic and the President of the Free Worlds sitting at the head of a long table patiently awaiting Teeneep.`
			`	The three sign a treaty granting safe passage to all Hai in human space, so long as they register with customs on Allhome before entering. Extensive surveillance fleets are posted on both sides of the wormhole to detect any kidnappings or other illegal travel. Now the only way for illicit transfers to happen is if a government employee is involved, but all three countries agreed to watch for that behavior and punish it severely.`
			`	After another few parties, the celebrations end. The leaders of all three governments thank you for your help with sincere words, and <payment>.`
