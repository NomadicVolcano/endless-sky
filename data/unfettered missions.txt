Only expensive, advanced, methods can work. The True Hai have too few terraforming supplies. In two years, the environment will collapse. In ten, the planet will not be farmed.`
			`	"The False Hai, the Fettered Hai, refuse to help terraform Warfeed. They fear it would make the True Hai strong. That fell deed burns their conscience. They send food out of guilt, so the True Hai will not starve. My brethren call it tribute, for they cannot face the truth."`

			`	"We've been analyzing options for transporting goods. The sheer quantity, hundreds of thousands of tons a year, is beyond what any smugglers can handle. That means we need to set up a large-scale operation, which means we need governments behind us. The Navy or Republic authorities would turn us in. That leaves the Syndicate and Deep Security.`

			`It takes a while to find the atmospheric physics researchers among the thousands of research projects on Valhalla. Eventually you find an intern studying the use of polygonal eyewalls in persistent polar storms on gas giants to determine details of the giants' solid cores. Her words are hard to parse; many of them are technical jargon, four to eight syllables long. After a few minutes, she stops talking long enough for you to explain your problem. Her eyes glow like a lightbulb, and she takes you to the head of her research group.`
			`	You find the research head standing next to a giant panel of equations and plots, manipulating them using a computer algebra system. You recognize some equations from your pilot training. One group of equations are the laws of motion of matter exiting hyperspace. Another group is the Navier-Stokes equations. Somehow the two groups of equations mix to terraform a planet, though you can't follow the reasoning. The math is a decade or two of education beyond your introductory knowledge.`

			`	"Of course we want alien terraforming technology, but you need to understand Deep Security's limitations. The reason they have permission to travel without Navy surveillance is that they never smuggle goods. Breaking that rule would cause long-term harm to all The Deep. I wish I could help Follower, but I can't.`

			`	You ask, "How do I get noticed?"`
			`	"They have a lot of contacts in pirate space. White River suggested hunting hunters, right? Follow that lead and see where it goes.`
			`	"You can try talking to unions; the Syndicate often funds their competitors' unions. Talk to Guncrag Watson on Shroud. See what happens.`
			`	"Come back to us when you have a solution. You'll be well paid, of course."`
			`	The terraformer hands you 100,000 credits. "There will be a lot more of that when you set up this smuggling operation."`

			`One escape pod leaves the ship. Your scanners indicate the person inside is quite small, so it must be Sparkle Snuggles. Though the galaxy is filled with moral ambiguity, murdering helpless children is usually considered wrong. You decide against pulling the trigger.`
			`	It seems likely she'll survive. Her escape pod is on a course to the nearest inhabited planet, her life-signs are strong, and she'll arrive long before she runs out of food. Hopefully she'll find a good therapist there, and better parents. Anywhere would be a better place to grow up than cramped quarters in a warship filled with psychos.`
			`	You alert the authorities to pick up her escape pod as soon as possible. They say they always have a child therapist and medical team on call for this sort of event. Apparently young children often escape exploding pirate vessels, usually with the help of adults or older children. Perhaps, in the face of death, even the worst among us are capable of selfless acts of love?`

# Threatening presents from Sparkle Snuggles
phrase "six-year-old scary presents"
	word
		"You receive an intimidating present from Sparkle Snuggles. "
	word
		`It's a large piece of paper with a pair of footprints made from a six-year-old's paint-covered feet. Next to it, you see the words, "stomp yu!"`
		`It's a "get well soon" card where the word "well" has been replaced with "ded," written in crayon. Inside the card, there is a crayon drawing of a cat head eating a stick figure.`
		`It's a "happy birthday" card where "birth" has been replaced with "deth," written in crayon. Below that, you see the word "sune." Inside the card, you can see the words, "gona getcha" repeated over and over.`
		`It is a crayon drawing of a stick figure with a big ship above it. The ship is shooting the person with a dozen green rays. The stick figure is labeled, "<first> goz splat."`
		`It is a white cartoon cat with a dead person in its mouth, and blood running down its cheeks. Underneath the cat you see the words, "yoo luk tasty."`
		`It's a doll with your face on it. One eye is hanging out of the face, and a fake knife is stuck in the doll's back.`
		`It's a batch of cookies with words written in icing. Most of them say, "ded," "burn," or "soon." Your scanners say there are no poisons or toxins in the cookies, so you try a few. The cookies are delicious.`
		`It's a scale model of her ship, made out of paper, plastic, and glue. Attached to it is a card that says, "minez biggern yers."`
		`It's a cake that says, "happy deth day" on it. Your scanners say there are no poisons or toxins, so you try a bite. It is a mix of spicy avocado and chocolate, swirled together. The taste combination is a little strange, but oddly fulfilling.`
		`It's card-stock paper covered by a finger-painted smiling face with, "<first>" written above it. It looks like someone stabbed the paper repeatedly with safety scissors. The back is covered with sparkly heart stickers and the words, "gonna find yu!"`
		`It's a shirt that is exactly your size with the words, "Sparkle Snuggles Will Kill Me," printed on it.`
		`It's a pair of pants exactly your size with a six-year-old's boot-print on the butt. Accompanied is a card with stickers and crayon writing that says, "out te air lok."`
		`It is an urn that has been decorated with finger paint, sparkles, heart stickers, and skull-and-crossbones stickers. An attached letter says, "for yur ashez."`
		`It is a recipe book. The meat dishes' ingredients have been corrected in red crayon. Instead of listing the type of animal to be cooked, it says, "<first>," misspelled in various ways.`
		`It's a pile of pilot license cards with sparkly heart stickers on each one. You look up the license numbers and you see that the pilots were all killed by the same bounty hunter. Many of the hunted were not pirates or criminals, but had offended the Syndicate.`

# Videos of Sparkle Snuggle living her life while threatening you:
phrase "six-year-old video threats"
	word
		"You receive a threatening video from Sparkle Snuggles. "
	word
		`It opens with her grinning psychotically at the camera. She's hugging her bear in one hand and pointing at the camera with the other. She doesn't blink or move for about 30 seconds and then rolls on the floor laughing.`
		`Someone baked her cookies that she's decorating with icing and sprinkles. The patterns on the cookies look like your face. She eats them dramatically and growls angrily at the camera after every few bites.`
		`The room is dark and you can hear someone reading Sparkle Snuggles a "bedtime story." The story is actually a recipe book where the reader is replacing each ingredient with "<first>" or "<last>." You can hear Sparkle Snuggles's maniacal giggling in the background.`
		`She is dressed in a giant lizard suit in a cramped room filled with paper buildings and paper people. She's stomping violently through the room, smashing everything. Occasionally, she stops to rip the head off of a paper person. The people all have your name on them.`
		`She is sitting in bed, playing with two toy ships. One looks like her ship, and one looks like your flagship. She wooshes them around in the air and then smashes your flagship into the bed. After doing this several times, she points at you and laughs meanly.`
		`She is sitting in a chair, listing what she wants for her birthday presents. All the wishes involve your body parts being removed, smashed, set on fire, or fed to various animals. She ends by blowing you a kiss.`
		`She is in a large room, dancing to symphonic black metal. She's an impressive dancer for her age. The floor has been colored in crayon writing of your name (misspelled eight different ways) and "ded" repeated over and over.`
		`She is at a steel table, making a crude paper model of your flagship. After she finishes, she climbs up on the table and sits on the paper model. She climbs back down and gives you a sweet smile while holding your smashed flagship.`
		`You see her making person-shaped paper cutouts with your name on them. After she finishes each one, she throws it into an oven where it catches fire and burns quickly to ashes.`
		`Sparkle Snuggles is in a cramped bathroom taking a bubble bath. She's almost fully submerged; only her face and one arm can be seen through the bubbles. In her hand, there is a person-shaped sponge. She looks at the camera and yells, "this you!" Then she dunks the person-sponge in water for a few seconds, pulls it out, smashes it repeatedly against the bathtub wall, and rips it in half. You hear about a half minute of maniacal giggling before she laughs so hard she falls all the way into the water. She emerges looking quite irate. The video fades to black as she grimaces at you.`
		`She's prancing up and down an hallway practicing the alphabet. "'A' is for anti-missile which make you helpless. 'B' is for bombs, which make you dead. 'C' is for cargo we'll steal from your ship. 'D' is for disruptors which make your shields useless. 'E' is for everyone whose gonna fear me..." She goes on like this for several minutes.`
		`She's standing on her bed in a full-body cat suit, making "meow" and cat-hissing noises, clawing threateningly at the camera. She ends by biting the head off a doll. You notice the doll's face looks like yours.`
		`She's sitting in a kitchen singing dark nursery rhymes while making people-shaped cutouts from paper. Each time she cuts one out, she writes your name on it, misspelled differently each time, and then rips the head off. This goes on for several minutes until she runs out of paper and wanders off eating a sandwich. She comes back a minute later and says, "oopes," and turns off the video recorder.`
		`She's in a large room, head-banging to death metal music. In the background, you can see a two-meter-tall picture of your face. Someone wrote on it, in large letters, "ded," using red finger paint. You look closely and see the girl's fingers are covered with red paint, and it's dripping onto the floor. This gives the impression of a pool of blood at her feet. When the music ends, she blows a kiss at you, which leaves her mouth and nose covered with a red hand-print. You hear maniacal giggling as the video fades to black.`
		`She is napping in a chair, wearing skull-and-crossbones pajamas. Crumbs and wrappers are sprinkled nearby from her recently-eaten food rations. You can hear her talking in her sleep. Most of the words are related to food, but you occasionally hear your name, followed by "burn." Eventually she rolls over and falls off the chair, awakens in mid-air, and stops herself from hitting the ground. She looks angrily at the camera, says your name, and then walks to a nearby bed. The sleep-mumbling resumes as the video fades to black.`

	`	"You've been played since the moment you got into this project. I work for a powerful group of marauders, and they set me up as an agent with White River. He helped me steal some alien tech and specs from the Syndicate, so we could make new armor. The Veiled Suns were how he arranged my rescue. We shut down White River's connections to this project by having the Unfettered send a list of carefully-chosen names to the Syndicate through you. Now we have what we need to make thousands of tons of armor for an advanced, new, fleet of marauder ships.`
	`	"Now I'll give you a present." She leads you out of her suite through a secret door.`

	`	You're in a large room, and you see a pile of slimy reptile scales made of metal. It looks like a stronger version of the armor in Lilith's crashed ship.`
	`	"This isn't the armor I invented. It isn't what we stole from the Syndicate either. This is the original. It is all that remains of a wrecked ship - a formerly living ship - on Stormhold. It was found in a deep-core archaeology dig; we suspect it crashed millions of years ago and got buried by tectonic activity.`
	`	"It is very old. Impossibly old. Maybe older than Earth. Telltale signs of hyperspace activity on the hull show it entered hyperspace millions of times. It is mildly radioactive. From the type of radiation, it is clear that it flew through the centers of stars. It may have even lived in them. When this... skin... was new, it would have been nearly invincible and could render the creature completely invisible. Even in its dormant state, this is the strongest material I know of.`
	`	"I don't want to think about what would happen if the Marauders or Syndicate mastered its technology. Really, this technology is too advanced for anyone. Please find a way to destroy it. Meet me in the spaceport when you have 13 tons of outfit space free and I'll give it to you."`
