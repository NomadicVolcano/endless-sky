Only expensive, advanced, methods can work. The True Hai have too few terraforming supplies. In two years, the environment will collapse. In ten, the planet will not be farmed.`
			`	"The False Hai, the Fettered Hai, refuse to help terraform Warfeed. They fear it would make the True Hai strong. That fell deed burns their conscience. They send food out of guilt, so the True Hai will not starve. My brethren call it tribute, for they cannot face the truth."`

		`	"We've been analyzing options for transporting goods. The shear quantity, hundreds of thousands of tons, is beyond what any smugglers can handle. That means we need to set up a large-scale operation, which means we need governments behind us.
		`	"The best option is to find a group that can transport goods without being scanned by the Navy. In this area, that would be the Navy, Navy Intelligence, Republic Intelligence, and Deep Security."`

		`It takes a while to find the atmospheric physics researchers among the thousands of research projects on Valhalla. Eventually you find an intern studying the use of polygonal eyewalls in persistent polar storms on gas giants to determine details of the giants' solid cores. Her words are hard to parse, as many of them are technical jargon, four to eight syllables long. After a few minutes, she stops talking long enough for you to explain your problem. Her eyes glow like a lightbulb and she takes you to the head of her research group.`
		`	The strongest and tallest pregnant woman the human race has ever produced stands before you, next to a giant panel of equations and plots. You recognize some of the equations from your pilot training. One group of equations are the laws of motion for matter exiting hyperspace. Another group is the Navier-Stokes equations. Somehow the two groups of equations are mixed, resulting in terraforming, though you can't follow the reasoning. The math is a decade or two of education beyond your introductory knowledge.`
		choice
			`	(Continue.)`
		`You explain the matter in detail to the research group head, who turns out to be a better listener than her intern.`
		`	"Of course we want Hai terraforming technology, but you need to understand Deep Security's limitations. The reason they have permission to travel without Navy surveillance is that they never smuggle goods. Breaking that rule would cause long-term harm to all of The Deep. I wish I could help Follower, but I can't.
		`	"Your only option left is the Syndicate. The Paradise Planets would turn you in if you even suggested such a plan, and the Navy is to honorable to smuggle.`

			`	"They have a lot of contacts in pirate space. White River suggested hunting hunters, yes? Follow that lead and see where it goes.`
