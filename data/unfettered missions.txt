			`You struggle to find a person or place called "Whispering Rose" to no avail. Eventually you stumble upon a red store that sells wind chimes, and has a rose as its emblem. The rose originates from Human space, so it is suspiciously out-of-place here.`
			`	A Hai child pokes your side with her paw and says, "You <first>? There. There. Go." She points towards the back of the shop at a door labeled, "Staff Only."`
			`	Beyond the door, you meet a Hai woman; from appearances, she is probably the child's mother.`

			`	You nod.`
			`	"They live on three dying planets to the north. Only one planet still gives food: Warfeed. Even there, the land can barely be farmed. The planet is too far gone for normal terraforming. Only expensive, advanced, methods can work. The True Hai have too few terraforming supplies. In two years, the environment will collapse. In ten, the planet will not be farmed.`
			`	"The False Hai, the Fettered Hai, refuse to help terraform Warfeed. They fear it would make the True Hai strong. That fell deed burns their conscience. They send food out of guilt, so the True Hai will not starve. My brethren call it tribute, for they cannot face the truth."`

			`	"The True Hai cannot fly to Human space. The False Hai kill us if we try. We must smuggle supplies across Hai space, through the uninhabited wastes, deep into your Human Republic. That is too far for one ship's journey."`

			`	You explain what Whispering Rose told you.`

			`	"You will also need to pay a hefty bribe to Syndicate executives, and they'll want something bigger than money.`

			`	"As for the pirates, there's a bounty hunter near Freedom that they despise. Her name is Deviled Smegs. Visit Earth and arrange for a bounty on yourself. Take down the hunter and you may get noticed by someone who is heard at Greenrock.`

We can birth viable children of an Alpha, but the children are not Alphas. With a few more genetic tweaks, the scientists would have succeeded. The Republic found out about us and ordered the entire 'stock' destroyed; all of us. Some of us escaped, but the Republic has been hunting us since then.`

We lack the Alpha psychosis; instead we're chronically depressed. Our immune system is comparable to yours, but we have an extremely fast metabolism. Our lifespans are thirty to fifty years, and our body temperature is very high. Our main strength is our minds: we learn quickly, our memories are excellent, and the most foolish among us would be brilliant among Humans.`
			`	"Unfortunately, those differences matter not to the Republic. The danger we represent is too great, so they call us Alphas and hunt us as they do the true Alphas. Our science and resourcefulness has saved us from the Republic's genocidal rage, and from enslavement by the Alphas."`

			`You set your ship down near the position your locator orb provided and you see a crashed ship concealed nearby. The hull is torn, and you notice a layer of padding that looks like interference plating. Oddly, the plating is an oily green material instead of the usual silver.`

			`	"I can give you a better deal. Unlike the Veiled Sun, I do have the ears of the pirates: I'm negotiating a price for my new interference plating. I can negotiate for the Unfettered Hai as well. I'll give you 800,000 credits after our negotiations at Greenrock."`

Soon after, you're brought to a room entirely black but for one spotlight in the middle. You sit on a chair in the darkness while Lilith speaks in the light.`
			`	The conversation goes on for almost ten minutes as the shadow-veiled audience inquires about the invention, and the proposed deal with the Hai. They seem extremely intelligent, level-headed, and well-informed, not a trait of the pirate stereotype.`
			`	Eventually Lilith negotiates two settlements. There will be mass-production of her interference plating with 4% of sales going to her. The Unfettered smuggling operation will be off-limits to pirates, so long as the sending planet (Follower or Warfeed) pay 70 credits per ton of cargo.`
			`	Your newly-rich friend hands you 800,000 credits and a contract from the pirates. "Come find me on Greenrock again sometime. Good luck with your terraforming!"`
