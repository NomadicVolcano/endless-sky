Only expensive, advanced, methods can work. The True Hai have too few terraforming supplies. In two years, the environment will collapse. In ten, the planet will not be farmed.`
			`	"The False Hai, the Fettered Hai, refuse to help terraform Warfeed. They fear it would make the True Hai strong. That fell deed burns their conscience. They send food out of guilt, so the True Hai will not starve. My brethren call it tribute, for they cannot face the truth."`

			`It takes a while to find the atmospheric physics researchers among the thousands of research projects on Valhalla. Eventually you find an intern studying the use of polygonal eyewalls in persistent polar storms on gas giants to determine details of the giants' solid cores. Her words are hard to parse, as many of them are technical jargon, four to eight syllables long. After a few minutes, she stops talking long enough for you to explain your problem. Her eyes glow like a lightbulb and she takes you to the head of her research group.`
			`	The tallest pregnant woman the human race has ever produced stands before you, next to a giant panel of equations and plots. You recognize some of the equations from your pilot training. One group of equations are the laws of motion of matter exiting hyperspace. Another group is the Navier-Stokes equations. Somehow the two groups of equations mix to terraform a planet, though you can't follow the reasoning. The math is a decade or two of education beyond your introductory knowledge.`

The reason they have permission to travel without Navy surveillance is that they never smuggle goods. Breaking that rule would cause long-term harm to all of The Deep. I wish I could help Follower, but I can't.`

			`	You ask, "How do I get noticed?"`
			`	"They have a lot of contacts in pirate space. White River suggested hunting hunters, right? Follow that lead and see where it goes.`
			`	"You can try talking to unions; the Syndicate often funds their competitors' unions. Talk to Guncrag Watson on Shroud. See what happens.`
			`	"Come back to us when you have a solution. You'll be well paid, of course."`
			`	The terraformer hands you 100,000 credits. "There will be a lot more of that when you set up this smuggling operation."`

He helped me steal some alien tech and specs from the Syndicate so we could make new armor. The Veiled Suns were how he arranged my rescue. We shut down White River's connections to this project by having the Unfettered send a list of carefully-chosen names to the Syndicate. Now we have what we need to make thousands of tons of armor for an advanced, new, fleet of marauder ships.`

			`	"It is very old. Impossibly old. Probably older than Earth. Telltale signs of hyperspace activity show it entered hyperspace millions of times. Judging from the radiation and scorch marks, it must have flown through the centers of stars. It may have even lived in them. When this... skin... was new, it would have been nearly invincible and could render the creature completely invisible. Even in its dormant state, this is the strongest material I know of.`
